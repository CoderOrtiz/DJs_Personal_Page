    <p>I grew up in Flordia and my life dream was to do Naval Special Warfare. My fiance came in like a wecking ball and
        I decided to change course while in College. Long story short, I joined law enforcment and had commited two and
        a half years of my life to the profession. For a long list of personal and professional reasons I once again
        began to look for a new profession. For my current lifestyle, I discovered software engineering on TicTok and
        believe it is the perfect fit for my current life. I am currently enrolled at UCF's Coding Boot Camp and am
        doubling down on my schooling by participating in the Udemy Online Coding Boot Camp. If you too are just
        starting out, feel free to add me on GitHub! My username is currently Coder Ortiz. Thanks for stopping by and
        talk to you soon. Vist my GitHub page <a href="https://github.com/CoderOrtiz">here</a>.</p>
